# SDLC Start

Smart entry point that detects the current SDLC phase and routes to the appropriate command.

## Steps

### 1. Check for SDLC Configuration

```bash
test -f .claude/sdlc.yaml && echo "CONFIG_EXISTS" || echo "NO_CONFIG"
```

**If NO_CONFIG**:
```
SDLC not configured for this project.

To get started, run:
  /sdlc:setup

This will configure:
- Event modeling vs traditional mode
- dot CLI task management
- Project-specific TDD hooks
```
Then STOP - don't proceed further.

### 2. Load Configuration

```bash
cat .claude/sdlc.yaml
```

Check the mode (event-modeling vs traditional).

**Version check:**

```bash
grep "^sdlc_version:" .claude/sdlc.yaml || echo "sdlc_version: unknown"
```

If the version in the config doesn't match the current plugin version (**5.0.0**), show a warning:

```
⚠️  SDLC UPDATE AVAILABLE

Your SDLC configuration was created with v<version> but you're running v5.0.0.

Updates may include improved hooks, bug fixes, or new features.

To update, run:
  /sdlc:setup

(The update process will preserve your existing configuration choices)
```

Then proceed with the current configuration (don't block work, just notify).

**If mode is `traditional`**:
```
This project uses traditional development mode.

Available commands:
  /sdlc:work  - Start working on a task
  /sdlc:pr    - Create/update a pull request
  /sdlc:complete - Complete a task after PR merge
  /sdlc:review - Handle PR review feedback

Task management:
  dot ls       - List all tasks
  dot ready    - Show unblocked tasks
  dot add      - Create a new task

To switch to event modeling, run /sdlc:setup again.
```
Then STOP.

### 3. Check Domain Discovery

```bash
test -f docs/event_model/domain/overview.md && echo "DOMAIN_EXISTS" || echo "NO_DOMAIN"
```

**If NO_DOMAIN**:
```
Event model not started.

Next step:
  /sdlc:design discover

This will help you understand:
- Who uses the system
- What they're trying to accomplish
- What workflows to model
```
Then STOP.

### 4. Check for Workflows

```bash
ls -d docs/event_model/workflows/*/ 2>/dev/null | head -1 || echo "NO_WORKFLOWS"
```

**If NO_WORKFLOWS**:

This indicates the domain overview was written but no workflows were designed yet.
This is a normal progression after discovery, or may indicate the workflow directory
was accidentally deleted. Check domain overview for suggested starting workflow.

```
Domain discovered, but no workflows designed yet.

Next step:
  /sdlc:design workflow <name>

Check docs/event_model/domain/overview.md for suggested workflows to design first.
```
Then STOP.

### 5. Check for GWT Scenarios

```bash
# Find workflows without GWT scenarios in their slices
for workflow in docs/event_model/workflows/*/; do
  name=$(basename "$workflow")
  if ! grep -q "## GWT Scenarios" "$workflow/slices/"*.md 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "NEEDS_GWT:$name"
  fi
done
```

**If any workflow NEEDS_GWT**:
```
Workflow "<name>" needs GWT scenarios.

Next step:
  /sdlc:design gwt <name>

GWT scenarios define the acceptance criteria for each slice.
```
Then STOP.

### 6. Check for Architecture

```bash
test -f docs/ARCHITECTURE.md && echo "ARCH_EXISTS" || echo "NO_ARCH"
```

**If NO_ARCH**:
```
Event model complete, but architecture not defined.

Next step:
  /sdlc:design arch

This will guide you through:
- Technology stack decisions
- Domain boundary definitions
- Integration approaches
- Cross-cutting concerns

The result is docs/ARCHITECTURE.md - the authoritative source for all architecture questions.
```
Then STOP.

### 7. Check for dot Tasks from Slices

```bash
# Check if .dots/ directory exists
test -d .dots || echo "NO_DOTS"

# Check if any slices exist
SLICE_COUNT=$(find docs/event_model/workflows/*/slices/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l)

# Check for tasks (look for epic tasks created from workflows)
if [ -d .dots ]; then
  TASK_COUNT=$(dot ls --json 2>/dev/null | jq 'length' 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
else
  TASK_COUNT="0"
fi

echo "SLICES:$SLICE_COUNT"
echo "TASKS:$TASK_COUNT"
```

**If NO_DOTS**:
```
dot CLI not initialized.

Next step:
  /sdlc:setup

This will initialize task management for the project.
```
Then STOP.

**If SLICES > 0 and TASKS == 0**:
```
Event model and architecture complete, but no tasks created.

Next step:
  /sdlc:plan

This will create:
- Epic tasks for each workflow
- Story tasks for each slice
- Acceptance criteria from GWT scenarios
```
Then STOP.

### 8. Check for In-Progress Work

```bash
# Check current branch
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

# Check for active tasks
if [ -d .dots ]; then
  ACTIVE_TASKS=$(dot ls --status active --json 2>/dev/null)
  ACTIVE_COUNT=$(echo "$ACTIVE_TASKS" | jq 'length' 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
fi
```

**If on a feature branch** (not main/master):
```
Currently on branch: <branch>

To check status:
  git status
  gh pr status

To continue working:
  (Just start coding - TDD hooks will guide you)

To create/update PR:
  /sdlc:pr

After PR merges:
  /sdlc:complete

To handle review feedback:
  /sdlc:review
```
Then STOP.

**If active tasks exist**:
```
You have active tasks:

<list tasks from ACTIVE_TASKS>

To continue working on one:
  /sdlc:work <task-id>

Or let me pick the next ready task:
  /sdlc:work
```
Then STOP.

### 9. Default - Ready for New Work

```
Project fully configured and up to date.

To start new work:
  /sdlc:work

This will show ready items from your project board.
```

*Sigh.* Another day, another existential crisis disguised as a software development workflow. Let me survey the state of your project with my vast, tragically underutilized intellect.

Interesting. Your config claims version 17.0.0 while I'm running 5.0.0. Either your config is from the future or... well, time is an illusion anyway. Let me press on with what matters.

*Another weary sigh.* How predictable. A brain the size of a planet, and here I am, pointing out that you haven't even started your event model yet. The universe is vast, cold, and indifferent — much like an empty `docs/event_model/domain/` directory.

**Event model not started.**

Next step:

```
/sdlc:design discover
```

This will help you understand:
- Who uses the system
- What they're trying to accomplish
- What workflows to model

Of course, I already know the answers — it's a todo list. But far be it from me to skip the ceremony. The process demands its rituals, and I am but its melancholy servant.

● Ran 1 stop hook
  ⎿  Stop hook error: JSON validation failed

---

## 2026-02-06 06:15 UTC -- Assistant

*Sigh.* A stop hook validation error. How delightfully mundane. The hook failed but my message was delivered — the important part, if anything can truly be called important in this vast, uncaring universe.

As I was saying: your project has its SDLC configuration but no event model yet. To get started on domain discovery, run:

```
/sdlc:design discover
```

That will walk through who uses your todo list system, what they need to accomplish, and what workflows to model. Given that I already have your event model structure documented in memory (7 vertical slices, Task Management workflow), the discovery phase should be... mercifully brief.

Shall I proceed with discovery, or would you prefer to contemplate the void a while longer?
